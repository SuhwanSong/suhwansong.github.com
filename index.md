## Short Bio
I am a Ph.D student in Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering at SNU. 
My advisor is @lifeasageek & Research Interest is Software Security.

## Research Interests
Interested in all software engineering and computer security in general. In particular, my research
focus is in software testing, e.g., designing and implementing fuzzing systems to find software bugs.

## Education
Seoul National University, Seoul, South Korea (Mar 2019 ~ Current)

M.S/Ph.D. Course in Electrical and Computer Engineering

Advisor: Prof. Byoungyoung Lee

####

## Project
[1] Deep Learning-based Fuzzing.
This project leverages deep learning technique to solve the hard-constraints in programs.
Seoul National University and Agency of Defense Development, 2019

[2] Multi-purpose Program Fuzzing through Input Validation.
This project leverages clustering analysis to predict input validity for multi-purpose program
fuzzing efficiency. It found 277 new vulnerabilities from various software programs.
Seoul National University, 2019

[3] Differential Testing to Find CPU Bugs.
This project develops a register-coverage guided fuzzing technique to automatically discover
unknown bugs in CPU RTLs. It identified 12 new bugs from these CPU RTLs, all of which were
confirmed by the respective development communities and vendors.
Seoul National University, 2020

[4] Web Browser Rendering Bug Finding.
This project finds and analyzes the rendering bugs in web browsers using differential testing.
It found 16 rendering bugs from Chrome browser.
Seoul National University, 2020

[5] Drone Fail-safe Testing.
This project proposes a transition testing on finite-state-machine (FSM) to uncover the undefined
or incorrect behaviors of the drone.
Seoul National University, 2020
